E-Commerce Website

The webpage features a navigation bar with various product categories, a slider displaying different sneaker models, sections highlighting features like free shipping and returns, a detailed product section, a gallery of images, and a promotional "New Season" section. Additionally, there is a footer with links to different website sections, a newsletter subscription form, and social media links.

The accompanying JavaScript code enhances the interactivity of the webpage. It allows users to navigate through different products when clicking on menu items, change the displayed product's image and details based on color selection, and open a payment information section when clicking on the "BUY NOW!" button.
